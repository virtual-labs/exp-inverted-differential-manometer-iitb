<h2>Inverted U-tube Differential Manometer</h2>

<p> It consists of an inverted U-tube, containing a light liquid. The two ends of the tube are connected to the points whose difference of pressure is to be measured. It is used for measuring difference of low pressures.</p>

<br>

<p>Fig. 1 shows an inverted U-tube differential manometer connected to the two points A and B. Let the pressure at A is more than the pressure at B.</p>

<p>Let</p>

<p>
&emsp;&emsp; h<sub>1</sub> = Height of liquid in left limb below the datum line X-X <br> 
&emsp;&emsp; h<sub>2</sub> = Height of liquid in right limb <br> 
&emsp;&emsp; h =  Difference of light liquid <br> 
&emsp;&emsp; &rho;<sub>1</sub> = Density of liquid at A <br> 
&emsp;&emsp; &rho;<sub>2</sub> = Density of liquid at B <br> 
&emsp;&emsp; &rho;<sub>s</sub> = Density of light liquid <br> 
&emsp;&emsp; P<sub>A</sub> = Pressure at A <br> 
&emsp;&emsp; P<sub>B</sub> = Pressure at B <br> 
</p>

<p>Taking X-X as datum line. Then pressure in the left limb below X-X</p>

$$ = P_A - \rho_1 × g × h_1 $$

<p>Pressure in the right limb below X-X</p>

$$ = P_B - \rho_2 × g × h_2 - \rho_s × g × h $$

<p>Equating the two pressure</p>

$$ P_A - \rho_1 × g × h_1 = P_B - \rho_2 × g × h_2 - \rho_s × g × h $$
$$ P_A - P_B = \rho_1 × g × h_1 - \rho_2 × g × h_2 - \rho_s × g × h $$
